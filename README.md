Description:

This website is intended to serve as a tool for rowers to assist with training using the
Concept2 ergometer. The workouts provided are adapted from Tufts University Varsity
Women's Rowing Coach Brian Dawe and his webpages, tuftscrew.org and tuftsoarsmen.org.
The calculation of training splits  is adapted from data in an article in Volker Nolte's 
collection Rowing Faster, specifically Kurt Jensen's "Monitoring Athlete's Physiology"

Development Timeline


Phase 1: Completed!

Create a simplified, login-free interface allowing users to access the training resources of
tuftscrew.org (tuftsoarsmen.org) which renders well on mobile devices.
Uses local storage to save user preferences (target 2k)

Phase 2: Completed!

Enable workouts to be displayed easily on a mobile device (or pc) using resources native to
fleetofthemalden.com, independent of tuftscrew.org/tuftsoarsmen.org
This requires a proprietary database of all workouts (Completed September 2013), a web
server built to hold the database and deliver information to the user (Completed September
2013), fine tuned algorithms to determine appropriate training splits (ongoing), and
an interface to render the workout information for the user which can be viewed easily on
a mobile device (Completed September 2013).

Create an interface to allow users to submit their own custom workouts.
_

Phase 6: Expected Fall/Winter 2014

Develop iOS app that implements all existing features of fleetofthemalden.com
Future expansion of iOS application:
