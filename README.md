Description:

This website is intended to serve as a tool for rowers to assist with training using the
Concept2 ergometer. The workouts provided are adapted from Tufts University Varsity
Women's Rowing Coach Brian Dawe and his webpages, tuftscrew.org and tuftsoarsmen.org.
The calculation of training splits  is adapted from data in an article in Volker Nolte's 
collection Rowing Faster, specifically Kurt Jensen's "Monitoring Athlete's Physiology"

Development Timeline


Phase 1: Completed!

Create a simplified, login-free interface allowing users to access the training resources of
tuftscrew.org (tuftsoarsmen.org) which renders well on mobile devices.
Uses local storage to save user preferences (target 2k)

Launched February 2013
_

Phase 2: Expected November 2013

Enable workouts to be displayed easily on a mobile device (or pc) using resources native to
fleetofthemalden.com, independent of tuftscrew.org/tuftsoarsmen.org
This requires a proprietary database of all workouts (Completed September 2013), a web
server built to hold the database and deliver information to the user (Completed September
2013), fine tuned algorithms to determine appropriate training splits (in progress), and
an interface to render the workout information for the user which can be viewed easily on
a mobile device (in progress).
_

Phase 3: Expected December 2013

Implement a feedback system to allow users to rate the difficulty of the workout.
Server necessary to handle requests is already implemented
_

Phase 4: Expected February 2014

Create a calendar view with linked workouts for each team.
_

Phase 5: Expected Spring 2014

Create an interface to allow users to submit their own custom workouts.
_

Phase 6: Expected Fall/Winter 2014

Develop iOS app that implements all existing features of fleetofthemalden.com
Future expansion of iOS application:
-Enable ability to sync iOS device with concept2 ergometer to instantly enter pre-set workouts
-Enable ability to store data collected from concept2 erg and upload it to 
	concept2.com and/or tuftscrew.org/tuftsoarsmen.org
_

Phase 7: TBD

Scale and potentially monetize website/iOS app resources to be available to rowing programs worldwide
